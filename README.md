# [MTGeni.us](https://mtgeni.us) Uncube

_Uncube_ colloquially refers to a
[_Magic: the Gathering_ cube](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Cube_Draft) dedicated to
cards that are only legal in the Cube Draft format, primarily focused on
[silver-bordered cards](http://mtg.gamepedia.com/Silver-bordered).

_This_ uncube, in addition to silver-bordered cards, contains
[unreleased _Magic: the Gathering_ artwork](https://github.com/mtgenius/uncube/tree/master/artwork),
[cards from unreleased and digital-only sets](https://github.com/mtgenius/uncube/tree/master/cards),
[emblems](https://github.com/mtgenius/uncube/tree/master/emblems) for those
cards, and [tokens](https://github.com/mtgenius/uncube/tree/master/tokens) for
those cards.

## Why are only some cards "premium"?

In order to support
[Super Secret Tech](https://scryfall.com/card/unh/141/super-secret-tech),
creature cards and cards with generic mana costs are premium if they exist as
paper prints.
