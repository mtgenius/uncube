# [MTGeni.us](https://mtgeni.us) Uncube

An _Uncube_ is a
[_Magic: the Gathering_ cube](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Cube_Draft) dedicated to
cards that are only legal in the Cube Draft format, with a heavy focus on
[silver-bordered cards](http://mtg.gamepedia.com/Silver-bordered).

In addition to silver-bordered cards, this repository contains a collection of
resources for perfecting an Uncube with
[unreleased _Magic: the Gathering_ artwork](https://github.com/mtgenius/uncube/tree/master/artwork),
[cards from unreleased and digital-only sets](https://github.com/mtgenius/uncube/tree/master/cards),
[emblems](https://github.com/mtgenius/uncube/tree/master/emblems) for those
cards, and [tokens](https://github.com/mtgenius/uncube/tree/master/tokens) for
those cards.
